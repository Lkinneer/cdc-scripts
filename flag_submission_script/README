so this script makes two different requests one to: https://iscore.iseage.org/red/flag/lookup/
and one to: https://iscore.iseage.org/red/flag/capture/

to use the script:

go to those urls in a web browser
open the networking section in the dev tools
make a request to lookup a flag
make a request to capture a flag (you can put in the wrong flag data)

for each reqest make note of
csrftoken
sessionid
csrfmiddlewaretoken

then change the print_flag_data and submit_flag functions so they include this data

then run the script with the following arguments
python3 submit_flags.py --reason "default creds" some_flags.txt

where "some_flags.txt" is a file of flag data seperated by newlines
